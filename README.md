### ü§î Why create this basic OS?

This project aims to provide a hands-on learning experience in operating system concepts by building a simplified simulator from the ground up. It allows exploration of fundamental OS components such as user authentication, process management, and memory allocation in a controlled C++ environment.

The initial phase focuses on establishing a solid foundation for future development, ensuring a modular and extensible structure for more complex OS features to be added progressively.

## ‚õì Features
- **Simulated Boot Process**: Displays a boot-up message to the user upon program start.
- **Basic Program Structure**: Organized C++ files (`main.cpp`, `auth.h`, `auth.cpp`).
- **Simple Authentication**: `authenticateUser()` function prompts for username and password, verifying against hardcoded credentials (`admin` / `password123`).


---

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get your copy of SimOS running locally, follow these simple steps.

### Requirements
- **C++ Compiler**: `g++` (or equivalent)
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **make**: (Optional, but recommended for easy compilation).

### Installation

#### Download or Clone the Project

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Jesus-DSP/TAMIU-OS-Simulator-Project.git
```

Now cd into the project directory:

```shell
cd TAMIU-OS-Simulator-Project
```

#### Step 1: Compile the Code

This step takes your C++ source files from the `src` directory and uses the `g++` compiler to create a single executable program in the `bin` directory.

First, if the `bin` directory doesn't exist, create it:

```bash
mkdir -p bin
```

Now, run the compilation command:

```bash
g++ src/main.cpp src/auth.cpp -o bin/os_simulator
```

### Config

#### .gitignore

Ensure you have a `.gitignore` file in your root directory to exclude compiled binaries and other unnecessary files from your repository. A minimal `.gitignore` for this project should include:

```gitignore
# Ignore the binary/executable directory
bin/
```

### Step 2: Run the Program

After the command in Step 1 finishes without errors, your program is ready to run. To execute it, you just need to type the path to the new program file.

Run this command:

```bash
./bin/os_simulator
```

Your program will then start running in the terminal. üëç

## üî® Development

### Tech Stack

The project is built using:

- C++: The core programming language.
- g++: The GNU C++ Compiler for compilation.

---

## ‚òëÔ∏è TODOs

- [ ] Implement a more robust user management system (e.g., storing credentials in a file).
- [ ] Expand the main function to include a basic command-line shell after authentication.
- [ ] Add unit tests for the authentication function and other modules.

---

## ‚ú® Future Features

- Command-line Interface (CLI): A functional shell for user interaction.
- Process Management: Basic simulation of process creation, scheduling, and termination.
- Memory Management: Simple memory allocation and deallocation.
- File System: A basic simulated file system.
- Error Handling: More comprehensive error handling for user input and system operations.

---

## Changelog

Please see `CHANGELOG.md` for more information on what has changed recently.
(You will need to create this file manually as the project evolves.)
